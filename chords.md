# The CHORDS platform for data 

[CHORDS](https://chordsrt.com) is a free and open source data platform for
storing all types of dat onto a cloud platform (your own or a commercial platform like AWS, Azure, etc.), but it is especially well
suited for atmospheric data of the type that would
come from weather stations.

## How CHORDS works

CHORDS operates on a simple workflow:  

1. given a data **data producer** (sensor, instrument, machine, etc.), 
2. the data is **put into CHORDS** over the Internet, 
3. the data  can then be **visualized** and then
4. the data can be **retrieved, archived, analyzed** or sent to other devices (or whatever else you'd like to do with it).

This image shows the basic operation of CHORDS:
