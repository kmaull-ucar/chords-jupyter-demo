# Using Python for CHORDS

Now that we can see the data manually, let's 
do it programmatically.

We will use Python to do this and in our demo, we will
do it with a Jupyter notebook, though you can
do it in a Python interpreter and just save
the output file on the filesystem since it will
not otherwise be visible.

Jupyter is an excellent platform and 
we will find it to be a fantastic tool
for the kinds of data analysis _and learning_
we would like to do with Python.  Give it a try
you will soon find it to be easy to use
and may help lower the barriers to learning
Python.

## Create a notebook

Once we load Jupyter, we can create a notebook
and begin the process of implementation.

## Implementation sketch

In our implementation, we want to programmatically 
do what we did manually:

1. get data from CHORDS API
2. store it in a file
3. load it for analysis and visualization

## Notebook implementation
