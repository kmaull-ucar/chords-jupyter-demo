# Wrap Up

We have now shown how to get data from CHORDS 

* [manually](./demos/chords-get-data-restman.md) in  a browser and   
* [programmatically](./demos/chords-get-data-python.ipynb) through Python.

Once you have the data that you want, the sky is the limit on analysis.  Some basic questions we might ask are statistical, such as the average temperatures over a period of time, minimums and maximums.  

Intermediate questions might ask things such as:

* how to correlate temperatures with humidity, 
* how humidity with changes in wind, or 
* how air quality changes with changes in wind or precipitation

Advanced question might include (with enough data), _what the temperature might be like tomorrow_.  Soon enough, you'd be developing your own weather forecasts.
